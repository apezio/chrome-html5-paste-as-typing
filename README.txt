Useful for pasting text into Supermicro iKVM HTML Console windows (and probably lots of other things).

Install instructions:

1) Download and extract zipped folder
2) Open Chrome://extensions
3) Toggle/Enable "Deleoper Mode" in upper right
4) Click "Load Unpacked" and select the Unzipped folder 'chrome-paste-as-keystrokes-main'.
5) Pin the extension Icon for this extenion. (click Extensions icon in the browser window, and Pin this extension)

Clicking the extension icon will simulate keystrokes of the contents of the clipboard.  

It also works via Option-Shift-v on Mac, or Alt-Shift-v on Windows.

Note:  For Supermicro HTML5/iKVM the default pop-up window has a limited version of the Chrome menubar (so you can't view or click extension icons).  So, either use the keyboard shortcut (option-shift-v), or copy the URL of the current HTML5 page and paste it into a new tab or new window.  The new tab or window will have the full Chrome menubar.
